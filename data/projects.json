    "description": "• Developing a mobile app that uses a YOLOv12-based computer vision model to detect ingredients from user photos and suggest personalized recipes via a custom matching algorithm.\n• Trained and optimized the object detection model with a custom dataset achieving 70% accuracy, then converted and deployed it using TensorFlow Lite and ONNX to enable efficient, real-time mobile performance.\n• Integrated the model into the app workflow, including real-time image capture, preprocessing (resizing, normalization), prediction, and UI display, ensuring optimized runtime and high prediction accuracy.\n• Prepared and cleaned a recipe dataset (Food.com) using Python scripting with Pandas to handle missing data and normalization, and created visualizations with Matplotlib to validate data quality.\n• Exploring deployment of vision model via cloud-based endpoints (e.g., Firebase Functions or GCP AI Platform). \n• Documented all stages of development, from data preparation to deployment, to support future collaboration.",
